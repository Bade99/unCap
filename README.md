# unCap
A simple Windows app for removing SDH comments from subtitle files

### Win32 + C/C++
Everything is made right next to the base windows API, the main goal is to comprehend as much as possible about how Windows works and then do it yourself, handmade controls, non client, menus, renderer ...<br/>
The focus here is placed on Windows 10 but most of the things I do are useful for any version of the OS

### Goals (90% completed)
* Fully colorizable in realtime
* 100% hand painted and handled
* Framework for future projects

### Supported File Formats

* SubRip (.srt)
* Substation Alpha (.ssa)
* Advanced Substation Alpha (.ass)
